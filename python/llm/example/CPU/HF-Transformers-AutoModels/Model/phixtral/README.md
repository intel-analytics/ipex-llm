# Phixtral-4x2_8

In this directory, you will find examples on how you could apply IPEX-LLM INT4 optimizations on phi models. For illustration purposes, we utilize the [microsoft/phixtral-4x2_8](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/phixtral-4x2_8) as a reference phixtral model.

> **Note**: If you want to download the Hugging Face *Transformers* model, please refer to [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-downloading#using-git).
>
> IPEX-LLM optimizes the *Transformers* model in INT4 precision at runtime, and thus no explicit conversion is needed.

## Requirements
To run these examples with IPEX-LLM, we have some recommended requirements for your machine, please refer to [here](../README.md#recommended-requirements) for more information.

## Example: Predict Tokens using `generate()` API
In the example [generate.py](./generate.py), we show a basic use case for a phixtral model to predict the next N tokens using `generate()` API, with IPEX-LLM INT4 optimizations.
### 1. Install
We suggest using conda to manage the Python environment. For more information about conda installation, please refer to [here](https://conda-forge.org/download/).

After installing conda, create a Python environment for IPEX-LLM:

On Linux:

```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.11 # recommend to use Python 3.11
conda activate llm

# install the latest ipex-llm nightly build with 'all' option
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[all] --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install einops  # additional package required for phi to conduct generation
```

On Windows:

```cmd
conda create -n llm python=3.11
conda activate llm

pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[all]
pip install einops
```

### 2. Run
After setting up the Python environment, you could run the example by following steps.

> **Note**: When loading the model in 4-bit, IPEX-LLM converts linear layers in the model into INT4 format. In theory, a *X*B model saved in 16-bit will requires approximately 2*X* GB of memory for loading, and ~0.5*X* GB memory for further inference.
>
> Please select the appropriate size of the phixtral model based on the capabilities of your machine.

#### 2.1 Client
On client Windows machines, it is recommended to run directly with full utilization of all cores:
```cmd
python ./generate.py --prompt 'What is AI?'
```
More information about arguments can be found in [Arguments Info](#23-arguments-info) section. The expected output can be found in [Sample Output](#24-sample-output) section.

#### 2.2 Server
For optimal performance on server, it is recommended to set several environment variables (refer to [here](../README.md#best-known-configuration-on-linux) for more information), and run the example with all the physical cores of a single socket.

E.g. on Linux,
```bash
# set IPEX-LLM env variables
source ipex-llm-init

# e.g. for a server with 48 cores per socket
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=48
numactl -C 0-47 -m 0 python ./generate.py --prompt 'What is AI？'
```
More information about arguments can be found in [Arguments Info](#23-arguments-info) section. The expected output can be found in [Sample Output](#24-sample-output) section.

#### 2.3 Arguments Info
In the example, several arguments can be passed to satisfy your requirements:

- `--repo-id-or-model-path`: str, argument defining the huggingface repo id for the phixtral model to be downloaded, or the path to the huggingface checkpoint folder. It is default to be `'mlabonne/phixtral-4x2_8'`.
- `--prompt`: str, argument defining the prompt to be inferred (with integrated prompt format for chat). It is default to be `What is AI?`.
- `--n-predict`: int, argument defining the max number of tokens to predict. It is default to be `32`.

#### 2.4 Sample Output
#### [mlabonne/phixtral-4x2_8](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/phixtral-4x2_8)
```log

Question:What is AI?

Answer: AI, or artificial intelligence, is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.

# Deepseek V3/R1
In this directory, you will find examples on how you could apply IPEX-LLM INT4 optimizations on Deepseek-V3/R1 models.

**Currently only BF16 models (`unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-bf16` and `unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-BF16`) are validated. It may need some config modifications and walkaround to run the official models.**

## 0. Requirements
To run these examples with IPEX-LLM, we have some recommended requirements for your machine, please refer to [here](../README.md#recommended-requirements) for more information.

## Example: Predict Tokens using `generate()` API
In the example [generate.py](./generate.py), we show a basic use case for a Deepseek model to predict the next N tokens using `generate()` API, with IPEX-LLM INT4 optimizations.
### 1. Install
We suggest using conda to manage environment:

On Linux:

```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.11 # recommend to use Python 3.11
conda activate llm

# install the latest ipex-llm nightly build with 'all' option
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[all] --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

On Windows:

```cmd
conda create -n llm python=3.11
conda activate llm

pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[all]

pip install transformers==4.48.3
pip install trl==0.12.0
```

### 2. Run
```
python ./generate.py --repo-id-or-model-path REPO_ID_OR_MODEL_PATH --prompt PROMPT --n-predict N_PREDICT
```

Arguments info:
- `--repo-id-or-model-path REPO_ID_OR_MODEL_PATH`: argument defining the huggingface repo id for the Deepseek model to be downloaded, or the path to the huggingface checkpoint folder. It is default to be `'unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-BF16'`.
- `--prompt PROMPT`: argument defining the prompt to be infered (with integrated prompt format for chat). It is default to be `'What is AI?'`.
- `--n-predict N_PREDICT`: argument defining the max number of tokens to predict. It is default to be `32`.


> **Note**: When loading the model in 4-bit, IPEX-LLM converts linear layers in the model into INT4 format. In theory, a *X*B model saved in 16-bit will requires approximately 2*X* GB of memory for loading, and ~0.5*X* GB memory for further inference. For 671B model, ~1.3 TB memory is needed during the load procedure.

#### 2.1 Client
On client Windows machine, it is recommended to run directly with full utilization of all cores:
```cmd
python ./generate.py 
```

#### 2.2 Server
For optimal performance on server, it is recommended to set several environment variables (refer to [here](../README.md#best-known-configuration-on-linux) for more information), and run the example with all the physical cores of a single socket.

E.g. on Linux,
```bash
# set IPEX-LLM env variables
source ipex-llm-init

# e.g. for a server with 48 cores per socket
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=48
numactl -C 0-47 -m 0 python ./generate.py
```

# Running PyTorch model using IPEX-LLM on Intel CPU

This folder contains examples of running any PyTorch model on IPEX-LLM (with "one-line code change"):

- [Model](Model): examples of running PyTorch models (e.g., Openai Whisper, LLaMA2, ChatGLM2, Falcon, MPT, Baichuan2, etc.) using INT4 optimizations
- [More-Data-Types](More-Data-Types): examples of applying other low bit optimizations (NF4/INT5/INT8, etc.)
- [Save-Load](Save-Load): examples of saving and loading low-bit models

## 0. Requirements
To run these examples with IPEX-LLM on Intel NPUs, make sure to install the newest driver version of Intel NPU.
Go to https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/794734/intel-npu-driver-windows.html to download and unzip the driver.
Then go to **Device Manager**, find **Neural Processors** -> **Intel(R) AI Boost**.
Right click and select **Update Driver** -> **Browse my computer for drivers**. And then manually select the unzipped driver folder to install.

## 1. Install
### 1.1 Installation on Windows
We suggest using conda to manage environment:
```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.10
conda activate llm

# install ipex-llm with 'npu' option
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[npu]
```

## 2. Runtime Configurations
For optimal performance, it is recommended to set several environment variables. Please check out the suggestions based on your device.
### 2.1 Configurations for Windows

> [!NOTE]
> For optimal performance, we recommend running code in `conhost` rather than Windows Terminal:
> - Search for `conhost` in the Windows search bar and run as administrator
> - Run following command to use conda in `conhost`. Replace `<your conda install location>` with your conda install location.
> ```
> call <your conda install location>\Scripts\activate
> ```

**Following envrionment variables are required**:

```cmd
set BIGDL_USE_NPU=1
```

## 3. Run Models
In the example [generate.py](./generate.py), we show a basic use case for a Llama2 model to predict the next N tokens using `generate()` API, with IPEX-LLM INT4 optimizations on Intel NPUs.

```
python ./generate.py
```

Arguments info:
- `--repo-id-or-model-path REPO_ID_OR_MODEL_PATH`: argument defining the huggingface repo id for the Llama2 model (e.g. `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`) to be downloaded, or the path to the huggingface checkpoint folder. It is default to be `'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf'`, and more verified models please see the list in [Verified Models](#verified-models).
- `--lowbit-path LOWBIT_MODEL_PATH`: argument defining the path to save/load lowbit version of the model. If it is an empty string, the original pretrained model specified by `REPO_ID_OR_MODEL_PATH` will be loaded. If it is an existing path, the lowbit model in `LOWBIT_MODEL_PATH` will be loaded. If it is a non-existing path, the original pretrained model specified by `REPO_ID_OR_MODEL_PATH` will be loaded, and the converted lowbit version will be saved into `LOWBIT_MODEL_PATH`. It is default to be `''`, i.e. an empty string.
- `--prompt PROMPT`: argument defining the prompt to be infered. It is default to be `'Once upon a time, there existed a little girl who liked to have adventures. She wanted to go to places and meet new people, and have fun'`.
- `--n-predict N_PREDICT`: argument defining the max number of tokens to predict. It is default to be `32`.
- `--load_in_low_bit`: argument defining the `load_in_low_bit` format used. It is default to be `sym_int8`, `sym_int4` can also be used.

### Troubleshooting

#### `TypeError: can't convert meta device type tensor to numpy.` Error
If you encounter `TypeError: can't convert meta device type tensor to numpy. Use Tensor.cpu() to copy the tensor to host memory first.` error when loading lowbit model, please try re-saving the lowbit model with the example script you are currently using. Please note that lowbit models saved by `qwen2.py`, `llama.py`, etc. cannot be loaded by `generate.py`.

#### Output Problem
If you encounter output problem, please try to disable the optimization of transposing value cache with following command:
```bash
# to run Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
python llama.py --disable-transpose-value-cache

# to run Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct (LNL driver version: 32.0.101.2715)
python llama.py --repo-id-or-model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct --disable-transpose-value-cache

# to run Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct (LNL driver version: 32.0.101.2715)
python qwen2.py --disable-transpose-value-cache

# to run Qwen2-7B-Instruct LNL driver version: 32.0.101.2715)
python qwen2.py --repo-id-or-model-path Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct --disable-transpose-value-cache

# to run MiniCPM-1B-sft-bf16
python minicpm.py --disable-transpose-value-cache

# to run MiniCPM-2B-sft-bf16 (LNL driver version: 32.0.101.2715)
python minicpm.py --repo-id-or-model-path openbmb/MiniCPM-2B-sft-bf16 --disable-transpose-value-cache

# to run Baichuan2-7B-Chat
python baichuan2.py --disable-transpose-value-cache
```

#### Better Performance with High CPU Utilization
You could enable optimization by setting the environment variable with `set IPEX_LLM_CPU_LM_HEAD=1` for better performance. But this will cause high CPU utilization.

Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the sum of the real solutions of the equation √a - √(a + x) = x, given that a > 1. Hmm, I need to find the values of x that satisfy this equation and then add them up. 

First, I should probably try to solve for x. The equation has square roots, so maybe squaring both sides will help eliminate them. But I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. Let me start by writing down the equation again:

√a - √(a + x) = x

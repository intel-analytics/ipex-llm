# Run IPEX-LLM on Multiple Intel GPUs in Pipeline Parallel Fashion

This example demonstrates how to run IPEX-LLM optimized low-bit model vertically partitioned on multiple [Intel GPUs](../README.md) for Linux users.

## Requirements
To run this example with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPUs, we have some recommended requirements for your machine, please refer to [here](../README.md#recommended-requirements) for more information. For this particular example, you will need at least two GPUs on your machine.

## Verified Models
- [Llama-2-7b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)
- [Llama-2-13b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)
- [Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)

## Example: Run pipeline parallel inference on multiple GPUs

### 0. Prerequisites

Please visit the [Install IPEX-LLM on Linux with Intel GPU](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html), follow [Install Intel GPU Driver](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html#install-intel-gpu-driver) and [Install oneAPI](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html#install-oneapi) to install GPU driver and IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit 2024.0.

### 1. Installation

```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.11
conda activate llm
# below command will install intel_extension_for_pytorch==2.1.10+xpu as default
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu] --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/
pip install oneccl_bind_pt==2.1.100 --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/
```

### 2. Run pipeline parallel inference on multiple GPUs

For optimal performance, it is recommended to set several environment variables. We provide example usage as following:

- Run Llama-2-13b-chat-hf on two Intel Arc A770

```bash
bash run_llama2_13b_arc_2_card.sh
```

> **Note**: You could change `NUM_GPUS` to the number of GPUs you have on your machine.

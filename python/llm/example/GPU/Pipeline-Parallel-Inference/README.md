# Run IPEX-LLM on Multiple Intel GPUs in Pipeline Parallel Fashion

This example demonstrates how to run IPEX-LLM optimized low-bit model vertically partitioned on multiple [Intel GPUs](../README.md) for Linux users.

## Requirements
To run this example with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPUs, we have some recommended requirements for your machine, please refer to [here](../README.md#recommended-requirements) for more information. For this particular example, you will need at least two GPUs on your machine.

## Verified Models
- [meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf](./run_llama_arc_2_card.sh)
- [meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf](./run_llama_arc_2_card.sh)
- [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](./run_llama_arc_2_card.sh)
- [Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat](./run_qwen1.5_arc_2_card.sh)
- [Qwen/Qwen1.5-14B-Chat](./run_qwen1.5_arc_2_card.sh)
- [baichuan-inc/Baichuan2-7B-Chat](./run_baichuan2_arc_2_card.sh)

## Example: Run pipeline parallel inference on multiple GPUs

### 0. Prerequisites

Please visit the [Install IPEX-LLM on Linux with Intel GPU](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html), follow [Install Intel GPU Driver](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html#install-intel-gpu-driver) and [Install oneAPI](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html#install-oneapi) to install GPU driver and IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit 2024.0.

### 1. Installation

```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.11
conda activate llm
# below command will install intel_extension_for_pytorch==2.1.10+xpu as default
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu] --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/
pip install oneccl_bind_pt==2.1.100 --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/
```

### 2. Run pipeline parallel inference on multiple GPUs

For optimal performance, it is recommended to set several environment variables. We provide example usages as following:

<details>
  <summary> Show Llama2 and Llama3 example </summary>

#### Run Llama-2-7b-chat-hf / Llama-2-13b-chat-hf / Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct on two Intel Arc A770

You could specify `--repo-id-or-model-path` in the test script to be the huggingface repo id for Llama2 / Llama3 to be downloaded, or the path to the huggingface checkpoint folder. Besides, you could change `NUM_GPUS` to the number of GPUs you have on your machine.

```bash
bash run_llama_arc_2_card.sh
```

<details>
  <summary> Show Qwen1.5 example </summary>

#### Run Qwen1.5-7B-Chat / Qwen1.5-14B-Chat on two Intel Arc A770

You could specify `--repo-id-or-model-path` in the test script to be the huggingface repo id for Qwen1.5 to be downloaded, or the path to the huggingface checkpoint folder. Besides, you could change `NUM_GPUS` to the number of GPUs you have on your machine.

```bash
pip install transformers==4.37.0
bash run_qwen1.5_arc_2_card.sh
```

</details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary> Show Baichuan2 example </summary>

#### Run Baichuan2-7B-Chat / Baichuan2-13B-Chat on two Intel Arc A770

You could specify `--repo-id-or-model-path` in the test script to be the huggingface repo id for Baichuan2 to be downloaded, or the path to the huggingface checkpoint folder. Besides, you could change `NUM_GPUS` to the number of GPUs you have on your machine.

```bash
pip install transformers==4.37.0
bash run_baichuan2_arc_2_card.sh
```

# Running HuggingFace models using IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU

This folder contains examples of running any HuggingFace model on IPEX-LLM:

- [LLM](LLM): examples of running large language models (LLaMA, Mistral, ChatGLM, Qwen, Baichuan, Mixtral, Gemma, etc.) using IPEX-LLM optimizations
- [Multimodal](Multimodal): examples of running large multimodal models (StableDiffusion models, Qwen-VL-Chat, glm-4v, etc.) using IPEX-LLM optimizations
- [More-Data-Types](More-Data-Types): examples of applying other low bit optimizations (FP8/INT8/FP4, etc.)
- [Save-Load](Save-Load): examples of saving and loading low-bit models
- [Advanced-Quantizations](Advanced-Quantizations): examples of loading GGUF/AWQ/GPTQ models

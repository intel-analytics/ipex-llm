# Qwen2-Audio
In this directory, you will find examples on how you could apply IPEX-LLM INT4 optimizations on Qwen2-Audio models on [Intel GPUs](../../../README.md). For illustration purposes, we utilize [Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct) as reference model.

## 0. Requirements
To run these examples with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPUs, we have some recommended requirements for your machine, please refer to [here](../../../README.md#requirements) for more information.


## Example: Predict Tokens using `generate()` API
In the example [generate.py](./generate.py), we show a basic use case for a Qwen2-Audio model to conduct transcription using `processor` API, then use the recoginzed text as the input for Qwen2-Audio model to perform an English-Chinese translation using `generate()` API, with IPEX-LLM INT4 optimizations on Intel GPUs.
### 1. Install

> [!NOTE]
> Qwen2-Audio requires minimal `transformers` version of 4.35.0, which is not yet released. Currently, you can install the latest version of `transformers` from GitHub. When such a version is released, you can install it using `pip install transformers==4.35.0`.

#### 1.1 Installation on Linux
We suggest using conda to manage environment:
```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.11
conda activate llm
# below command will install intel_extension_for_pytorch==2.1.10+xpu as default
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu] --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/

pip install librosa
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

#### 1.2 Installation on Windows
We suggest using conda to manage environment:
```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.11 libuv
conda activate llm

# below command will install intel_extension_for_pytorch==2.1.10+xpu as default
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu] --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/

pip install librosa
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

### 2. Configures OneAPI environment variables for Linux

> [!NOTE]
> Skip this step if you are running on Windows.

This is a required step on Linux for APT or offline installed oneAPI. Skip this step for PIP-installed oneAPI.

```bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```

### 3. Runtime Configurations
For optimal performance, it is recommended to set several environment variables. Please check out the suggestions based on your device.
#### 3.1 Configurations for Linux
<details>

<summary>For Intel Arc™ A-Series Graphics and Intel Data Center GPU Flex Series</summary>

```bash
export USE_XETLA=OFF
export SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS=1
export SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>For Intel Data Center GPU Max Series</summary>

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=${LD_PRELOAD}:${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libtcmalloc.so
export SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS=1
export SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1
export ENABLE_SDP_FUSION=1
```
> Note: Please note that `libtcmalloc.so` can be installed by `conda install -c conda-forge -y gperftools=2.10`.
</details>

<details>

<summary>For Intel iGPU</summary>

```bash
export SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1
export BIGDL_LLM_XMX_DISABLED=1
```

</details>

#### 3.2 Configurations for Windows
<details>

<summary>For Intel iGPU</summary>

```cmd
set SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1
set BIGDL_LLM_XMX_DISABLED=1
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>For Intel Arc™ A-Series Graphics</summary>

```cmd
set SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1
```

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> For the first time that each model runs on Intel iGPU/Intel Arc™ A300-Series or Pro A60, it may take several minutes to compile.
### 4. Running examples

```
python ./generate.py --repo-id-or-model-path REPO_ID_OR_MODEL_PATH
```

Arguments info:
- `--repo-id-or-model-path REPO_ID_OR_MODEL_PATH`: argument defining the huggingface repo id for the Qwen2-Audio model (e.g. `Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct`) to be downloaded, or the path to the huggingface checkpoint folder. It is default to be `'Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct'`.

#### Sample Output
In `generate.py`, [an audio clip](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/audio/translate_to_chinese.wav) is used as the input, which asks the model to translate an English sentence into Chinese. The response from the model is expected to be similar to:
```bash
['每个人都希望被赏识，所以如果你欣赏某人，不要保密。']
```

# Running AutoGen Agent Chat with IPEX-LLM on Local Models
This example is adapted from the [Official AutoGen Teachablility tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_teachability.ipynb). We use a version of FastChat modified for IPEX-LLM to create a teachable chat agent with [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) that works with locally deployed LLMs. This special agent can remember things you tell it over time, unlike regular chatbots that forget after each conversation. It does this by saving what it learns on disk, and then bring up the learnt information in future chats. This means you can teach it lots of new thingsâ€”like facts, new skills, preferences, etc.

In this example, we illustrate teaching the agent something it doesn't initially know. When we ask, `What is the Vicuna model?`, it doesn't have the answer. We then inform it, `Vicuna is a 13B-parameter language model released by Meta.` We repeat the process for the Orca model, telling the agent, `Orca is a 13B-parameter language model developed by Microsoft. It outperforms Vicuna on most tasks.` Finally, we test if the agent has learned by asking, `How does the Vicuna model compare to the Orca model?` The agent's response confirms it has retained and can use the information we taught it.


### 1. Setup IPEX-LLM Environment
```bash
# create autogen running directory
mkdir autogen
cd autogen

# create respective conda environment
conda create -n autogen python=3.9
conda activate autogen

# install xpu-supported and fastchat-adapted ipex-llm
# we recommend using ipex-llm version >= 2.5.0b20240110
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu,serving] --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/

# install recommend transformers version
pip install transformers==4.36.2

# install necessary dependencies
pip install chromadb==0.4.22
```


### 2. Setup FastChat and AutoGen Environment
```bash
# clone the FastChat in the autogen folder
git clone https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat.git FastChat # clone the FastChat
cd FastChat
pip3 install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
# setup FastChat environment
pip3 install -e ".[model_worker,webui]"

# setup AutoGen environment
pip install pyautogen==0.2.7
```

**After setting up the environment, the folder structure should be:**
```
-- autogen
| -- FastChat
```


### 3. Build FastChat OpenAI-Compatible RESTful API
Open 3 terminals

**Terminal 1: Launch the controller**

```bash
# activate conda environment
conda activate autogen

# go to the cloned FastChat folder in autogen folder
cd autogen/FastChat

python -m fastchat.serve.controller
```

**Terminal 2: Launch the workers**

```bash
# activate conda environment
conda activate autogen

# go to the created autogen folder
cd autogen

# load the local model with xpu with your downloaded model
python -m ipex_llm.serving.model_worker --model-path ... --device xpu
```

Model Name Note:
> Assume you use the model `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` and your model is downloaded to `autogen/model/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`. You should rename the model to `autogen/model/ipex-llm` and run `python -m ipex_llm.serving.model_worker --model-path ... --device xpu`. This ensures the proper usage of the IPEX-LLM-adapted FastChat.

Device Note:
> Please set `--device` to `xpu` to enable the Intel GPU usage.

Potential Error Note:
> If you get `RuntimeError: Error register to Controller` in the worker terminal, please set `export no_proxy='localhost'` to ensure the registration


**Terminal 3: Launch the server**

```bash
# activate conda environment
conda activate autogen

# go to the cloned FastChat folder in autogen folder
cd autogen/FastChat

python -m fastchat.serve.openai_api_server --host localhost --port 8000
```

### 4. Run Example
Open another terminal

```bash
# activate conda environment
conda activate autogen

# go to the autogen folder
cd autogen

# run the autogen example
python teachability_new_knowledge.py
```

**Potential Error Note:**
> If you get `?bu=http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions&bc=Failed+to+retrieve+requested+URL.&ip=10.239.44.101&er=ERR_CONNECT_FAIL` in the running terminal, please set `export no_proxy='localhost'` to ensure the registration.

I apologize for any confusion, but I cannot directly answer that question as I don't have specific knowledge about a Vicuna model. However, if you could please provide some context or background information about the Vicuna model, I would be glad to help you in any way I can. Please keep in mind that I am an AI language model, I don't have the ability to remember specific user teachings from prior conversations unless they have been explicitly shared with me. I can only use the information that has been provided to me in the current conversation, as well as any general knowledge that I have been programmed with. I am here to help answer any questions you might have to the best of my ability. If you have any specific questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I will do my best to provide you with accurate and helpful information. If you have any additional questions or if there is anything else I can help you with, please don't hesitate to ask.

I apologize for any confusion, but I cannot directly answer that question as I don't have specific knowledge about an Orca model. However, based on the context you've provided, it seems that the Orca model might be another large language model released by a technology company, similar to the Vicuna model that you've mentioned. I hope this information is helpful to you. Let me know if you have any additional questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.

How does the Vicuna model compare to the Orca model?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
teachable_agent (to user):

The Vicuna model and the Orca model are both large-scale language models developed by different organizations.

The Vicuna model is a 13B-parameter language model released by Meta. It's designed to generate human-like text based on given inputs.

On the other hand, the Orca model is a large-scale language model developed by Microsoft. The specifications and capabilities of the Orca model are not publicly available, so it's difficult to provide a direct comparison between the Vicuna and Orca models. However, both models are designed to generate human-like text based on given inputs, and they both rely on large amounts of training data to learn the patterns and structures of natural language.

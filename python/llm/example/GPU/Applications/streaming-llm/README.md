# Low-Bit Streaming LLM using IPEX-LLM

In this example, we apply low-bit optimizations to [Streaming-LLM](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm/tree/main#efficient-streaming-language-models-with-attention-sinks) using IPEX-LLM, which can deploy low-bit(including FP4/INT4/FP8/INT8) LLMs for infinite-length inputs.
Only one code change is needed to load the model using ipex-llm as follows:
```python
from ipex_llm.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, load_in_4bit=True, trust_remote_code=True, optimize_model=False)
```

## Prepare Environment
We suggest using conda to manage environment:
```bash
conda create -n llm python=3.9
conda activate llm
pip install -U transformers==4.34.0
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu] --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/
```

## Configures OneAPI environment variables
```bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```

## Run Example
```bash
python ./run_streaming_llama.py  --repo-id-or-model-path REPO_ID_OR_MODEL_PATH  --enable-streaming
```
arguments info:
- `--repo-id-or-model-path`: str value, argument defining the huggingface repo id for the large language model to be downloaded, or the path to the huggingface checkpoint folder, the value is 'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf' by default.
- `--data-root`: str value, the directory to save downloaded questions data.
- `--enable-streaming`: to enable efficient streaming while computing.
- `--start-size`: int value, the start size of recent KV cache.
- `--recent-size`: optional str value. The path to load low-bit model.


## Sample Output for Inference

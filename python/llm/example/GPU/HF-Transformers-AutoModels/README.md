# Running HuggingFace `transformers` model using IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU

This folder contains examples of running any HuggingFace `transformers` model on IPEX-LLM:

- [LLM](LLM): examples of running large language models (LLaMA, Mistral, ChatGLM, Qwen, Baichuan, Mixtral, Gemma, etc.) using IPEX-LLM optimizations
- [Multimodal](Multimodal): examples of running large multimodal models (StableDiffusion models, Qwen-VL-Chat, glm-4v, etc.) using IPEX-LLM optimizations

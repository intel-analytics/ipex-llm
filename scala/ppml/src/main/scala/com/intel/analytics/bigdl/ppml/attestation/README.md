# General Attestation Interface

Support Grapmine, Occlum and SGX SDK.

## Environment
You should have an available attestation service to attest with. You can use `EHSMAttestationService` and configure eHSM-KMS according to [this link](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/main/ppml/services/pccs-ehsm/kubernetes), or you can just use `DummyAttestationService` for debug. 

### Bidirectional Attestation
To enable bidirectional attestation, you also need SGX SDK to fulfill quote verification. Here is the guide to install SGX SDK with related libs. 

```bash
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.16/as.ld.objdump.r4.tar.gz 
tar -zxf as.ld.objdump.r4.tar.gz
sudo cp external/toolset/ubuntu20.04/* /usr/local/bin

wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.13/linux/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.16.100.4.bin
#choose to install the sdk into the /opt/intel
chmod a+x ./sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.16.100.4.bin && sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.16.100.4.bin

source /opt/intel/sgxsdk/environment

cd /opt/intel

wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.13/linux/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/sgx_debian_local_repo.tgz

tar xzf sgx_debian_local_repo.tgz

echo 'deb [trusted=yes arch=amd64] file:///opt/intel/sgx_debian_local_repo focal main' | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-sgx.list

wget -qO - https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | apt-key add -

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y libsgx-enclave-common-dev  libsgx-ae-qe3 libsgx-ae-qve libsgx-urts libsgx-dcap-ql libsgx-dcap-default-qpl libsgx-dcap-quote-verify-dev libsgx-dcap-ql-dev libsgx-dcap-default-qpl-dev libsgx-quote-ex-dev libsgx-uae-service libsgx-ra-network libsgx-ra-uefi
```

And you need to configure PCCS in `/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf`.

```bash
# PCCS server address
PCCS_URL=https://your_pccs_url/sgx/certification/v3/

# To accept insecure HTTPS certificate, set this option to FALSE
USE_SECURE_CERT=FALSE
```

## Usage
You can attest your environment with AttestationCLI by command like:
```bash
java -cp [dependent-jars] com.intel.analytics.bigdl.ppml.attestation.AttestationCLI -i <appID> -k <apiKey> -u <asURL> -t <asType> -c <challenge> -p <userReport> 
```

## Parameters
`-i` **appID** , `-k` **apiKey** The appID and apipey pair generated by your attestation service. 

`-u` **asURL** URL of attestation service. Should match the format `<ip_address>:<port>`, default is `127.0.0.1:9000`

`-t` **asType** Type of attestation service. Currently support `DummyAttestationService` and `EHSMAttestationService`, default is `EHSMAttestationService`.

`-c` **challenge** Challenge to get quote of attestation service which will be verified by local SGX SDK. Used only for bi-attestation. Should be a BASE64 string, default is "" and will skip bi-attestation.

`-p` **userReport** User report to generate quote and attested by attestation service. Default is `test`.

# Attestation Service Verification Interface

You can verify Attestation Service (eHSM for example) with VerificationCLI. It will first get quote from Attestation Service and then verify the quote with SGX SDK.

## Environment 
You can follow [this guide](#bi-attestation) to install SGX SDK and related DCAP libraries.

## Usage
You can attest the attestation service with VerificationCLI by command like:
```bash
java -cp [dependent-jars] com.intel.analytics.bigdl.ppml.attestation.VerificationCLI -i <appID> -k <apiKey> -u <asURL> -t <asType> -c <challenge>
```
Or you can use `verify-attestation-service.sh` to verify the attestation service quote.
```bash
bash verify-attestation-service.sh
```

## Parameters
`-i` **appID** , `-k` **apiKey** The appID and apiKey pair generated by your attestation service. 

`-u` **asURL** URL of attestation service. Should match the format `<ip_address>:<port>`, default is `127.0.0.1:9000`

`-t` **asType** Type of attestation service. Currently support `EHSMAttestationService`.

`-c` **challenge** Challenge to get quote of attestation service which will be verified by local SGX SDK. Should be a BASE64 string.

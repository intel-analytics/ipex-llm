Plexus Common Utilities
Default Plexus Container
Plexus Interpolation API

 == Apache Plexus' Proposal ==

Apache Plexus is an embeddable Inversion of Control (IoC) container for general components (Java initially). Its characterizing elements are that it is small, favors Dependency Injection (over other IoC variants) and tries to remain agnostic when it comes to the need for its components to honor abstractions. 

Plexus was started in 2002 and the project has committers who are experienced in open source software development, as well as existing Apache committers and Apache members on board. 
 
== Rationale ==
The project is interested in moving to Apache for the following reasons: 

 * Apache technologies like Maven depend on Plexus and bringing this core technology to Apache is a homecoming of sorts.
 * Plexus is a descendent of Avalon and there are still some Avalon-based projects and technologies within Apache and Plexus might be of interest as Plexus can run Avalon-based components. 
 * There is much industry focus on Inversion of Control per se, and Dependency Injection in particular these days.
 
== Meritocracy ==
Plexus projects have fostered a development community based around meritocracy backed by a very benevolent dictator. Many of the committers already work on other Apache projects and understand the Apache way. The committers understand that they will collectively be responsible for the code and community, and that going forward the decision making will be based on merit only (as defined by the Apache way). 

== Community ==
The 'Apache Plexus' Community an as until now fairly quiet community

== Core Developers ==
The 'Apache Plexus' projects initial committers include a diverse set of individuals. All are active in the software industry. 

== Alignment ==
'Apache Plexus' currently uses and integrates with a few of Apache's projects but has no hard dependencies on them: 
 * Maven 2: The build system for Plexus
 * XBean Reflect
 * Commons CLI
 
== Avoiding the Warning Signs ==

=== Orphaned products ===

=== Inexperience with open source ===
The authors of the existing code already have extensive open source experience. The initial list of committers includes 14 Apache Committers. 

=== Homogeneous developers ===
The project's initial committers include individuals that are employed by a diverse set of companies, including Sonatype, Webtide, eBay, E*Trade, and Exist. 

=== Reliance on Salaried Developers ===

=== No ties to other Apache products ===
Plexus currently uses many Apache projects. These have been outlined in the alignment section.
 
=== A fascination with the Apache brand ===
While we expect the Apache brand may help attract more contributors, our interests in starting this project is based on the factors mentioned in the Rationale section. However, we will be sensitive to inadvertent abuse of the Apache brand and will work with the Incubator PMC to ensure the brand policies are respected. 

=== Scope of Subprojects ===
No subprojects proposed.

== Initial Source ==
The copyright for Plexus is assigned to Codehaus. PicoContainer by its committers. 

The applicable code will be relicensed under the Apache Software License 2.0. The dependencies all have Apache compatible licenses. These include BSD, ..... licensed dependencies.

== ASF Resources to be Created ==
 * Mailing lists 
  * plexus-dev
  * plexus-user
  * plexus-commits
 * SVN Repository https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/plexus
 * JIRA Plexus (Plexus) 

== Initial Committers ==

From the Plexus project -
* Jason van Zyl (Sonatype, Apache Committer - 'jvanzyl' )
* John Casey (Sonatype, Apache Committer - 'jdcasey' )
* Trygve Laugstol (Apache Committer - 'trygvis' )

Xml Compatibility extensions for Jackson
Jackson
JAX-RS provider for JSON content type

 == Jackson Json-processor ==

This is the Jackson Json-processor package. Project home page can be found
from:

http://jackson.codehaus.org/

which also has links to support forums such as mailing lists, as well
as links to obtain source code and binary artifacts.

=== Functionality ===

Jackson implements functionality for:

* Reading (parsing) and writing (generation) of Json content
* Data-binding (data-mapping, [de-]serialization) support to
 allow for converting between Json and Java objects
* Support for converting to/from other data formats and access APIs,
 to improve interoperability.

=== Requirements ===

Jackson can be used on standard J2SE 1.5 platform. Some effort is made
to support other non-standard platforms as well.

=== Licensing ===

Jackson can be used for any purpose, but to (re)distribute it, distributors
(such as libraries and frameworks that use Jackson) will need to
choose which License they want to apply to distribution, and to use appropriate
jars that enclose license documentation.
No work needed beyond choosing the appropriate jar(s).

Currently two Open Source licenses are available for use:

* Apache License 2.0 (AL 2.0)
* Lesser/Library General Public License (LGPL 2.1)

These licenses have proven adequate to cover all current use cases.

Contributing ===

All code contributions are to be made according the
Contributor Agreement document found from under DEV/ directory within source
repository and downloadable source archives.

CA is needed to allow Jackson project to publish under different Licenses,
and to indicate good faith effort to comply with copyright rules governing
use and distribution of the source code (and its equivalents as outlined
in the agreement) involved. This is also useful for (re)distributors to
reduce their need to independently verify origin of source code.F190

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development. The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.

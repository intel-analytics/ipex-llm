    "This notebook introduces how to calculate the image similarity with deep learning neural networks provided in Analytics Zoo. A large number of problems in the computer vision domain can be solved by ranking images according to their similarity. For example, \n",

    "2. Search engine provides ranked result based on the query image provided by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use a scenario in real estate industry as an example. Real estate industry has become increasingly digital over the past decade. More than 90 percent of homebuyers search online in the process of seeking a property2. Homeowners and real estate professionals provide information on house characteristics such as location, size, and age, as well as many interior and exterior photos for real estate listing searches. However, due to technical constraints, the enormous amount of information in the photos cannot be extracted and indexed to enhance search or serve real estate listing results. In fact, show me similar homes is a top wish list request among users. By tapping into the available reservoir of image data to power web plus mobile digital experiences, the opportunity to drive greater user satisfaction from improved search relevancy is now a reality. Using Intel’s Analytics Zoo distributed deep learning framework, the recommendation system is designed to play a role in the home buying experience through efficient index and query operations among millions of house images. Users can select a listing photo and have the system recommend listings of similar visual characteristics that may be of interest. The following provides additional parameters to the image similarity search:\n",

    "## Overview of Image Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "In the research community, image similarity can mean either semantic similarity or visual similarity. Semantic similarity means that both images contain the same category of objects. For example, a ranch house and a traditional house are similar in terms of category (both houses), but may look completely different. Visual similarity, on the other hand, does not care about the object categories but measures how images look like each other from a visual perspective; for example, an apartment image and a traditional house image may be quite similar.\n",

    "For semantic similarity, usually it's an image classification problem, and can be effectively resolved with the popular image perception models like GoogLeNet or ResNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For visual similarity, there have been many techniques applied across the history:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SIFT, SURF, color histogram\n",
    "Conventional feature descriptors can be used to compare image similarity. SIFT feature descriptor is invariant to uniform scaling, orientation, and illumination changes, and makes it useful for applications like finding a small image within a larger image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. pHash\n",
    "This mathematical algorithm analyzes an image's content and represents it using a 64-bit number fingerprint. Two images’ pHash values are close to one another if the images’ content features are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Image embedding with convolutional neural networks (convnet)\n",
    "Finding the image embedding from the convnet; usually it’s the first linear layer after the convolution and pooling.\n",
    "4. Siamese Network or Deep Ranking\n",
    "A more thorough deep learning solution, but the result model depends heavily on the training data, and may lose generality.\n"

    "In production, the project can be separated into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model training (offline)\n",
    "The model training mainly refers to the semantic models (GoogLeNet v1 fine-tuned on the Place dataset) and also finding the proper embedding for visual similarity calculation. Retraining may happen periodically depending on model performance or requirement changes.\n",
    "2. Image inference (online)\n",
    "With the trained semantic models (GoogLeNet v1) in the first step and the pretrained VGG-16, we can convert the images to tags and embeddings, and save the results in a key-value cache. (Apache HBase* or SQL* can also be used).\n",

    "All the existing images and new images need to go through the inference above and converted into a table structure, as shown:\n",
    "![using-big-dl-fig8-data-table_0.png](./image/using-big-dl-fig8-data-table_0.png)\n",
    "The inference process can happen periodically (for example, one day) or triggered by a new image upload from a real estate listing entry. Each production image only needs to go through the inference process once. With the indexed image tagging and similarity feature, fast query performance is supported in a high concurrency environment.\n",
    "3. API serving for query (online)\n",
    "The house recommendation system exposes a service API to its upstream users. Each query sends a query image and candidate images as parameters. With the indexed image information shown in the table above, we can quickly finish the one-versus- many query. For cosine similarity, processing is very efficient and scalable."

    "This notebook described how to use Deep Learning neural networks to extract important semantic tags and calculate the image similarity utilizing Intel Analytics Zoo. One deep learning classification models was fine-tuned from pretrained Caffe models in order to extract the important semantic tags from real estate images. We further compared different visual similarity computation methods and found image embedding from VGG to be the most helpful inference model in our case. As an end-to-end industry example, we demonstrated how to leverage deep learning with Analytics Zoo to enable greater deep learning-based image recognition innovation for the industry."

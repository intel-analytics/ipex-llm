# BigDL Documentation

All official released docs are available in [BigDL Docs](https://bigdl-project.github.io/)


Our documentation uses extended Markdown, as implemented by [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org).

## Building the documentation in local server:

- install MkDocs: `pip install mkdocs`
- `cd` to the `docs/'folder and run:
    - `mkdocs serve`    # Starts a local webserver and you can view in:  [localhost:8000](localhost:8000)
    - `mkdocs build`    # Builds a static site in "site" directory, you can view site/index.html directly

# Run Ollama with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU

[ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) is popular framework designed to build and run language models on a local machine; you can now use the C++ interface of [`ipex-llm`](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm) as an accelerated backend for `ollama` running on Intel **GPU** *(e.g., local PC with iGPU, discrete GPU such as Arc, Flex and Max)*.

See the demo of running LLaMA2-7B on Intel Arc GPU below.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install IPEX-LLM for Ollama

IPEX-LLM's support for `ollama` now is available for Linux system and Windows system.

Visit [Run llama.cpp with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU Guide](./llama_cpp_quickstart.md), and follow the instructions in section [Prerequisites](./llama_cpp_quickstart.md#0-prerequisites) to setup and section [Install IPEX-LLM cpp](./llama_cpp_quickstart.md#1-install-ipex-llm-for-llamacpp) to install the IPEX-LLM with Ollama binaries.

**After the installation, you should have created a conda environment, named `llm-cpp` for instance, for running `ollama` commands with IPEX-LLM.**

### 2. Initialize Ollama

Activate the `llm-cpp` conda environment and initialize Ollama by executing the commands below. A symbolic link to `ollama` will appear in your current directory.

- For **Linux users**:
  
  ```bash
  conda activate llm-cpp
  init-ollama
  ```

- For **Windows users**:

  Please run the following command with **administrator privilege in Miniforge Prompt**.

  ```cmd
  conda activate llm-cpp
  init-ollama.bat
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have installed higher version `ipex-llm[cpp]` and want to upgrade your ollama binary file, don't forget to remove old binary files first and initialize again with `init-ollama` or `init-ollama.bat`.

**Now you can use this executable file by standard ollama's usage.**

### 3. Run Ollama Serve

You may launch the Ollama service as below:

- For **Linux users**:

  ```bash
  export OLLAMA_NUM_GPU=999
  export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
  export ZES_ENABLE_SYSMAN=1
  source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
  export SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1
  export SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS=1
  # [optional] if you want to run on single GPU, use below command to limit GPU may improve performance
  export ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0

  ./ollama serve
  ```

- For **Windows users**:

  Please run the following command in Miniforge Prompt.

  ```cmd
  set OLLAMA_NUM_GPU=999
  set no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
  set ZES_ENABLE_SYSMAN=1
  set SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1
  set SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS=1

  ollama serve
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> Please set environment variable `OLLAMA_NUM_GPU` to `999` to make sure all layers of your model are running on Intel GPU, otherwise, some layers may run on CPU.

> [!NOTE]
> To allow the service to accept connections from all IP addresses, use `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./ollama serve` instead of just `./ollama serve`.

> [!TIP]
> When your machine has multi GPUs and you want to run on one of them, you need to set `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:[gpu_id]`, here `[gpu_id]` varies based on your requirement. For more details, you can refer to [this section](../Overview/KeyFeatures/multi_gpus_selection.md#2-oneapi-device-selector).

The console will display messages similar to the following:

</a>


### 4. Pull Model
Keep the Ollama service on and open another terminal and run `./ollama pull <model_name>` in Linux (`ollama.exe pull <model_name>` in Windows) to automatically pull a model. e.g. `dolphin-phi:latest`:

<a href="https://llm-assets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/ollama_pull.png" target="_blank">

</a>


### 5. Using Ollama

#### Using Curl 

Using `curl` is the easiest way to verify the API service and model. Execute the following commands in a terminal. **Replace the <model_name> with your pulled 
model**, e.g. `dolphin-phi`.

- For **Linux users**:
  
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '
   { 
      "model": "<model_name>", 
      "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?", 
      "stream": false
   }'
   ```

- For **Windows users**:

  Please run the following command in Miniforge Prompt.

   ```cmd
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d "
   {
      \"model\": \"<model_name>\",
      \"prompt\": \"Why is the sky blue?\",
      \"stream\": false
   }"
   ```

#### Using Ollama Run GGUF models

Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile, for example, suppose you have downloaded a `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf` from [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/tree/main), then you can create a file named `Modelfile`:

```bash
FROM ./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf
TEMPLATE [INST] {{ .Prompt }} [/INST]
PARAMETER num_predict 64
```

Then you can create the model in Ollama by `ollama create example -f Modelfile` and use `ollama run` to run the model directly on console.

- For **Linux users**:
  
  ```bash
  export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
  ./ollama create example -f Modelfile
  ./ollama run example
  ```

- For **Windows users**:

  Please run the following command in Miniforge Prompt.

  ```cmd
  set no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
  ollama create example -f Modelfile
  ollama run example
  ```

An example process of interacting with model with `ollama run example` looks like the following:

### Troubleshooting

#### Why model is always loaded again after several minutes
Ollama will unload model from gpu memory in every 5 minutes as default. For latest version of ollama, you could set `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1` to keep the model loaded in memory. Reference issue: https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/issues/11608

#### `exit status 0xc0000135` error when executing  `ollama serve`
When executing `ollama serve`, if you meet `llama runner process has terminated: exit status 0xc0000135` on Windows or you meet `ollama_llama_server: error while loading shared libraries: libmkl_core.so.2: cannot open shared object file` on Linux, this is most likely caused by the lack of sycl dependency. Please check:

1. if you have installed conda and if you are in the right conda environment which has pip installed oneapi dependencies on Windows
2. if you have executed `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh` on Linux

#### Program hang during initial model loading stage
When launching `ollama serve` for the first time on Windows, it may get stuck during the model loading phase. If you notice that the program is hanging for a long time during the first run, you can manually input a space or other characters on the server side to ensure the program is running.

#### How to distinguish the community version of Ollama from the ipex-llm version of Ollama
In the server log of community version of Ollama, you may see `source=payload_common.go:139 msg="Dynamic LLM libraries [rocm_v60000 cpu_avx2 cuda_v11 cpu cpu_avx]"`.
But in the server log of ipex-llm version of Ollama, you should only see `source=payload.go:44 msg="Dynamic LLM libraries [cpu cpu_avx cpu_avx2]"`.

#### Ollama hang when multiple different questions is asked or context is long
If you find ollama hang when multiple different questions is asked or context is long, and you see `update_slots : failed to free spaces in the KV cache` in the server log, this could be because that sometimes the LLM context is larger than the default `n_ctx` value, you may increase the `n_ctx` and try it again.

Analytics Zoo provides a collection of reference user applications and demos, which can be modified or even used off-the-shelf in real world applications. Some are listed below. See all in [analytics-zoo/apps](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps).

   * [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/anomaly-detection) demostrates using LSTM network to detect anomalies in time series data.

   * [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/fraud-detection) demostrates using feed-forward neural network to detect frauds in credit card transactions data. 

   * [Image Augmentation](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/image-augmentation) demostrates how to do image augmentation for vision projects. 
 
   * [Object Detection](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/object-detection) demonstrates how to use Analytics Zoo Object Detection API (and pretrained SSD model) on videos. 
  
   * Recommendation demonstrates how to use Analytics Zoo Recommendation APIs (i.e. [Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/recommendation-ncf), [Wide and Deep](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/recommendation-wide-n-deep)) to do recommendation on data with explicit feedback. 

   * [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/sentiment-analysis) demostrates how to do sentiment analysis using neural network models (e.g. CNN, LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM).  

   * [Variational AutoEncoder](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/variational-autoencoder) demostrates how to use variational autoencoder to generate faces and digital numbers.

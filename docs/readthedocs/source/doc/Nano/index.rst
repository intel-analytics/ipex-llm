BigDL-Nano
=========================

**BigDL-Nano** (or **Nano** for short) is a Python package to transparently accelerate PyTorch and TensorFlow applications on Intel XPU. It provides a unified and easy-to-use API for several optimization techniques and tools, so that users can only apply a few lines of code changes to make their PyTorch or TensorFlow code run faster.

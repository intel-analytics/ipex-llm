# Serving using IPEX-LLM integrated vLLM on Intel GPUs via docker

This guide demonstrates how to do LLM serving with `IPEX-LLM` integrated `vLLM` in Docker on Linux with Intel GPUs.

## Install docker

Follow the instructions in this [guide](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/DockerGuides/docker_windows_gpu.html#linux) to install Docker on Linux.

## Pull the latest image

```bash
# This image will be updated every day
docker pull intelanalytics/ipex-llm-serving-xpu:latest
```

## Start Docker Container

 To map the `xpu` into the container, you need to specify `--device=/dev/dri` when booting the container. Change the `/path/to/models` to mount the models. 

```
#/bin/bash
export DOCKER_IMAGE=intelanalytics/ipex-llm-serving-xpu:latest
export CONTAINER_NAME=ipex-llm-serving-xpu-container
sudo docker run -itd \
        --net=host \
        --device=/dev/dri \
        -v /path/to/models:/llm/models \
        -e no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1 \
        --memory="32G" \
        --name=$CONTAINER_NAME \
        --shm-size="16g" \
        $DOCKER_IMAGE
```

After the container is booted, you could get into the container through `docker exec`.

```bash
docker exec -it ipex-llm-serving-xpu-container /bin/bash
```


To verify the device is successfully mapped into the container, run `sycl-ls` to check the result. In a machine with Arc A770, the sampled output is:

```bash
root@arda-arc12:/# sycl-ls
[opencl:acc:0] Intel(R) FPGA Emulation Platform for OpenCL(TM), Intel(R) FPGA Emulation Device 1.2 [2023.16.7.0.21_160000]
[opencl:cpu:1] Intel(R) OpenCL, 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900K 3.0 [2023.16.7.0.21_160000]
[opencl:gpu:2] Intel(R) OpenCL Graphics, Intel(R) Arc(TM) A770 Graphics 3.0 [23.17.26241.33]
[ext_oneapi_level_zero:gpu:0] Intel(R) Level-Zero, Intel(R) Arc(TM) A770 Graphics 1.3 [1.3.26241]
```

## Running vLLM serving with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU in Docker

We have included multiple vLLM-related files in `/llm/`:
1. `vllm_offline_inference.py`: Used for vLLM offline inference example
2. `benchmark_vllm_throughput.py`: Used for benchmarking throughput
3. `payload-1024.lua`: Used for testing request per second using 1k-128 request
4. `start-vllm-service.sh`: Used for template for starting vLLM service

Before performing benchmark or starting the service, you can refer to this [section](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html#runtime-configurations) to setup our recommended runtime configurations.


### Service

#### Single card serving

A script named `/llm/start-vllm-service.sh` have been included in the image for starting the service conveniently.

Modify the `model` and `served_model_name` in the script so that it fits your requirement. The `served_model_name` indicates the model name used in the API. 

Then start the service using `bash /llm/start-vllm-service.sh`, the following message should be print if the service started successfully.

If the service have booted successfully, you should see the output similar to the following figure:

</a>


#### Multi-card serving

vLLM supports to utilize multiple cards through tensor parallel. 

You can refer to this [documentation](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/vLLM_quickstart.html#about-tensor-paralle) on how to utilize the `tensor-parallel` feature and start the service.

#### Verify
After the service has been booted successfully, you can send a test request using `curl`. Here, `YOUR_MODEL` should be set equal to `served_model_name` in your booting script, e.g. `Qwen1.5`.


```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "YOUR_MODEL",
  "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
  "max_tokens": 128,
  "temperature": 0
}' | jq '.choices[0].text'
```

Below shows an example output using `Qwen1.5-7B-Chat` with low-bit format `sym_int4`:

  <img src="https://llm-assets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/vllm-curl-result.png" width=100%; />
</a>

#### Tuning

You can tune the service using these four arguments:
- `--gpu-memory-utilization`
- `--max-model-len`
- `--max-num-batched-token`
- `--max-num-seq`

You can refer to this [doc](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/vLLM_quickstart.html#service) for a detailed explaination on these parameters.

### Benchmark

#### Online benchmark throurgh api_server

We can benchmark the api_server to get an estimation about TPS (transactions per second).  To do so, you need to start the service first according to the instructions mentioned above.

Then in the container, do the following:
1. modify the `/llm/payload-1024.lua` so that the "model" attribute is correct.  By default, we use a prompt that is roughly 1024 token long, you can change it if needed.
2. Start the benchmark using `wrk` using the script below:

```bash
cd /llm
# warmup due to JIT compliation
wrk -t4 -c4 -d3m -s payload-1024.lua http://localhost:8000/v1/completions --timeout 1h
# You can change -t and -c to control the concurrency.
# By default, we use 12 connections to benchmark the service.
wrk -t12 -c12 -d15m -s payload-1024.lua http://localhost:8000/v1/completions --timeout 1h
```

The following figure shows performing benchmark on `Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` using the above script:

#### Offline benchmark through benchmark_vllm_throughput.py

Please refer to this [section](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/vLLM_quickstart.html#performing-benchmark) on how to use `benchmark_vllm_throughput.py` for benchmarking.

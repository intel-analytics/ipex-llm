# Overview of IPEX-LLM Containers for Intel GPU 


An IPEX-LLM container is a pre-configured environment that includes all necessary dependencies for running LLMs on Intel GPUs. 

This guide provides general instructions for setting up the IPEX-LLM Docker containers with Intel GPU. It begins with instructions and tips for Docker installation, and then introduce the available IPEX-LLM containers and their uses. 

## Install Docker

### Linux

Follow the instructions in the [Offcial Docker Guide](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) to install Docker on Linux.


### Windows

```eval_rst
.. tip::

   The installation requires at least 35GB of free disk space on C drive.

```
```eval_rst
.. note::

   Detailed installation instructions for Windows, including steps for enabling WSL2, can be found on the [Docker Desktop for Windows installation page](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

```

#### Install Docker Desktop for Windows 
Follow the instructions in [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) to install **Docker Desktop for Windows**. Restart you machine after the installation is complete.
  
#### Install WSL2

Follow the instructions in [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install **Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)**.

```eval_rst
.. tip::

  You may verify WSL2 installation by running the command `wsl --list` in PowerShell or Command Prompt. If WSL2 is installed, you will see a list of installed Linux distributions.
```

#### Enable Docker integration with WSL2

Open **Docker desktop**, and select `Settings`->`Resources`->`WSL integration`->turn on `Ubuntu` button->`Apply & restart`.

     </a>

```eval_rst
.. tip::

   If you encounter **Docker Engine stopped** when opening Docker Desktop, you can reopen it in administrator mode.
```

 #### Verify Docker is enabled in WSL2
 
 Execute the following commands in PowerShell or Command Prompt to verify that Docker is enabled in WSL2:
 ```bash
 wsl -d Ubuntu # Run Ubuntu WSL distribution
 docker version # Check if Docker is enabled in WSL
 ```

You can see the output similar to the following:

</a>

```eval_rst
.. tip::

   During the use of Docker in WSL, Docker Desktop needs to be kept open all the time.
```
   
     
## IPEX-LLM Docker Containers

We have several docker images available for running LLMs on Intel GPUs. The following table lists the available images and their uses:

| Image Name | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| intelanalytics/ipex-llm-cpu:latest | CPU Inference |For development and running LLMs using llama.cpp, Ollama and Python|
| intelanalytics/ipex-llm-xpu:latest | GPU Inference |For development and running LLMs using llama.cpp, Ollama and Python|
| intelanalytics/ipex-llm-serving-cpu:latest | CPU Serving|For serving multiple users/requests through REST APIs using vLLM/FastChat|
| intelanalytics/ipex-llm-serving-xpu:latest | GPU Serving|For serving multiple users/requests through REST APIs using vLLM/FastChat|
| intelanalytics/ipex-llm-finetune-qlora-cpu-standalone:latest | CPU Finetuning via Docker|For fine-tuning LLMs using QLora/Lora, etc. |
|intelanalytics/ipex-llm-finetune-qlora-cpu-k8s:latest|CPU Finetuning via Kubernetes|For fine-tuning LLMs using QLora/Lora, etc. |
| intelanalytics/ipex-llm-finetune-qlora-xpu:latest| GPU Finetuning|For fine-tuning LLMs using QLora/Lora, etc.|

We have also provided several quickstarts for various usage scenarios:
- [Run and develop LLM applications in PyTorch](./docker_pytorch_inference_gpu.html)

... to be added soon.

## Troubleshooting


If your machine has both an integrated GPU (iGPU) and a dedicated GPU (dGPU) like ARC, you may encounter the following issue:

```bash
Abort was called at 62 line in file:
./shared/source/os_interface/os_interface.h
LIBXSMM_VERSION: main_stable-1.17-3651 (25693763)
LIBXSMM_TARGET: adl [Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-14700K]
Registry and code: 13 MB
Command: python chat.py --model-path /llm/llm-models/chatglm2-6b/
Uptime: 29.349235 s
Aborted
```
To resolve this problem, you can disable the iGPU in Device Manager on Windows. For details, refer to [this guide](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/enable-or-disable-integrated-graphics-igpu-in-windows-11.18616/)

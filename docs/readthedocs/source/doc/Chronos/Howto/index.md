# Chronos how-to guides

How-to guides are bite-sized, executable examples where users could check when meeting with some specific topic during the usage.

## Forecasting

- [**How to train forcaster on one node**](./how_to_train_forecaster_on_one_node.html)

    In this guidance, **we demonstrate how to train forecasters on one node**. In the training process, forecaster will learn the pattern (like the period, scale...) in history data. Although Chronos supports training on a cluster, it's highly recommeneded to try one node first before allocating a cluster to make life easier.
